Here you can find answers to the most common questions and problems that
students contact us for. Please read through this page before getting in touch with us.

## How can i change my router from Static IP to DHCP?

- First, plug your router in and connect to it (even if the Router has no internet connection)
- In your web-browser of choice, open the control panel of your Router. Typically, it is 192.168.01 or 192.168.1.1 (for TP-Link) but it can be a different address depending on the manufacturer.
- Enter your admin credentials (this is NOT your wifi password. if you don't remember, you will have to reset your router)
- Go to WAN/Internet Settings -> Select DHCP (Dynamic IP)
- Remove any manually entered IP, Subnet, Gateway, or DNS (if applicable)

Save changes. You're done!

## How do I reset my router?

- Find the "reset" button: In the back of your router, near the ports, there should be a "reset" button. Sometimes, it is a little hole that you have to insert a sharp small object into, like a small pen or staples (tacker nadeln)
- Insert the staple or hold the button for 10 seconds. If your router has lights, it could be blinking.
- Afterwards, it will be reset to factory settings. The default WIFI credentials (SSID and Password) will be in the back of the device.

## How can I set up my router?

If your router is brand-new, simply plug it in with an Ethernetkabel, and connect to it using the SSID and Password, which is on the back of the device
If it is not new, follow the instructions above to either Reset the Router (we recommend this to non-technical people!) or to reconfigure your router following the instructions above. 

## My internet is slow, what can I do?

If this problem occurs during peak times (e.g. in the evening),
it is likely caused by the limited capacity of the dormitory network infrastructure.
Sadly, we cannot do anything to change this. If your internet connection is also
inconsistent, please see [My internet is inconsistent, what can I do](#my-internet-is-inconsistent-what-can-i-do).

## My internet is inconsistent, what can I do?

You can try the following approaches:

- Try Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi. Connect an Ethernet cable from your router's yellow or orange port to your  computer's Ethernet port. 
  Newer notebooks may   need a USB-C to Ethernet adapter.
- If you are using a rather cheap WIFI router, you can try upgrading to a more powerful one.
  Olynet offers preconfigured routers for this purpose. If you are interested, stop by
  [in our office during the opening hours](/#opening-hours).
- Try a different Ethernet cable to connect to the wall-mounted network outlet. If you don't have another cable, you   can purchase one from Olynet.
  [in our office during the opening hours](/#opening-hours).
- If the problem still persists, we can visit your apartment and check whether your
  wall-mounted network outlet is defective. If it is, we will forward your case to the
  Studentenwerk that handles further repairs.

## Where are the network outlets located?

## Into which outlet and which port should I plug my cable?

The exact port is specified on the IP-sheet:

Usually the ports are also labelled with "Telefon" (Phone) and "Internet". Plug the
cable into the internet port.

## Can I use a different ISP for a faster internet?

No.

## I have a DSL router, will it work in this dormitory?

No.

## Does it cost anything for Olynet to configure my router or help me with any problems that I have?

No, we are a student club consisting of volunteers, our work is free of charge. If you decide to
purchase hardware from us, you will however have to pay for it.

## I still have questions, how can I contact you?

Shoot us a [mail](mailto:office@olynet.club) or stop by our office during the [opening hours](/#opening-hours).
