On the one hand, your data is collected when you communicate it to us.

## 2. Hosting

### External hosting

This website is hosted externally. The personal data collected on this website is stored on the
host's servers. This can primarily be IP addresses, meta and communication data, contact data,
names, website access and other data generated via a website.

The external hosting takes place for the purpose of fulfilling the contract with our potential
and existing customers (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. b DSGVO) and in the interest of a secure, fast and
efficient provision of our online offer by a professional provider (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f DSGVO).

If a corresponding consent was requested, the processing takes place exclusively on the basis
of Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO and ยง 25 Abs. 1 TTDSG) within the meaning of the TTDSG. In this
case, the consent can be revoked at any time.

Our hoster will only process your data to the extent that this is necessary to fulfil its
performance obligations and will follow our instructions in relation to this data.

We use the following hoster:

Vercel Inc.  
440 N Barranca Ave #4133  
Covina, CA 91723  
E-mail: privacy@vercel.com

Vercel is a cloud deployment platform.

As the basis for data processing and data transfer to recipients based in third countries, Vercel
uses standard contractual clauses (Art. 46. Abs. 2 and 3 DSGVO), i.e. templates provided by
the EU Commission, which ensure that your data also comply with European data protection
standards if these are stored and processed in third countries such as the USA.

These terms of the Standard Contractual Clauses can be found at
https://vercel.com/legal/Vercel_Inc_-_Data_Processing_Addendum.pdf.

For more information about the data processed through the use of Vercel, please visit

## 3. General information and mandatory information

### Data Protection

The operators of this site take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat
your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection
regulations and this Privacy Policy.

If you use this website, various personal data will be collected. Personal data is data with which
you can be personally identified. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect and what
we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.

We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating
by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of the data against access by third
parties is not possible.

### Responsible body

The responsible body for data processing on this website is:

OlyNet eV  
Helene-Mayer-Ring 7B / 2. floor (GAP)  [Google Maps](https://g.page/r/CYubh5FnTtN0EBI/)
80809 Munich  
E-mail: office@olynet.club

The responsible body is the natural or legal person who, alone or together with others, decides
on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).

### Storage duration

Unless a storage period has been specified in this Privacy Policy, your personal data will remain
with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate
request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted
unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. tax or
commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the data will be deleted once these
reasons have ceased to exist.

### Legal basis of data processing on this website

If you have consented to the data processing, we will process your personal data on the basis
of Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO or Art. 9 Abs. 2 lit. a DSGVO, if special data categories according
to Art. 9 Abs. 1 DSGVO are processed. In the event of express consent to the transfer of
personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO.
If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device (e.g.
via device fingerprinting), data processing is also based on ยง 25 Abs. 1 TTDSG. In this case, the
consent can be revoked at any time.

If your data is required to fulfil the contract or to conduct pre-contractual measures, we
process your data on the basis of Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. b DSGVO.

Furthermore, we process your data if they are required to fulfil a legal obligation on the basis
of Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. c DSGVO.

Data processing can also take place on the basis of our legitimate interest in accordance with
Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The following paragraphs of this Privacy Policy provide information
on the relevant legal bases in each individual case.

### Note on data transfer to the USA and other third countries

Among other things, we use tools or services (such as server locations) from companies based
in the USA or other third countries that are not considered secure under data protection law.
If these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to and processed in these third
countries. We would like to point out that in these countries no level of data protection
comparable to that of the EU can be guaranteed. For example, US companies are obliged to
release personal data to security authorities without you as the person concerned being able
to take legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US authorities will
process, evaluate and permanently store your data on US servers for monitoring purposes.
We have no influence on these processing activities.

### Revocation of your consent to data processing

Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke
consent that you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing that took
place up until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.

### Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct advertising (Art.

### 21 DSGVO)

If the data is processed on the basis of Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. e or f DSGVO, you have the right at any
time to object to the processing of your personal data for reasons that arise from your
particular situation; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. The respective
legal basis on which processing is based can be found in this Privacy Policy. If you object, we
will no longer process your affected personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling
legitimate grounds for processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or the
processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims (Objection according to Art. 21
Abs. 1 DSGVO).

If your personal data is processed to operate direct advertising, you have the right to object
at any time to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of such advertising; this
also applies to profiling as far as it is associated with such direct advertising. If you object, your
personal data will then no longer be used for direct advertising purposes (objection according
to Art. 21 Abs. 2 DSGVO).

### Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority

In the event of violations of the DSGVO, the data subject has the right to lodge a complaint
with a supervisory authority (Art. 77 DSGVO), particularly in the Member State of their
habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge
a complaint is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.

### Right to data portability

You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or
in fulfilment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-
readable format (Art. 20 DSGVO). If you request the direct transfer of the data to another
person responsible, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.

### Information, deletion and correction

Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free
information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of the
data processing (Art. 15 DSGVO) and, if necessary, a right to correction (Art. 16 DSGVO) or
deletion (Art. 17 DSGVO) of this data. You can contact us at any time if you have any further
questions on the subject of personal data.

### Right to restriction of processing

You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data (Art. 18
DSGVO). You can contact us at any time for this. The right to restriction of processing exists in
the following cases:

- If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to
  check this. For the duration of the examination, you have the right to request that the
  processing of your personal data be restricted.
- If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can
  request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
- If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert
  legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal
  data instead of being deleted.
- If you have lodged an objection in accordance with Art. 21 Abs. 1 DSGVO, your interests
  and ours must be weighed up. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests
  prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal data.

If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data โ apart from its storage

- may only be used with your consent or to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or to protect
  the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the
  European Union or a Member State are processed.

### SSL or TLS encryption

For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or
inquiries that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can
recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address bar of the browser shows
"https://" (instead of "http://") and by the lock symbol in your address bar.

If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data that you transmit to us cannot be read by third
parties.

### Objecting to promotional e-mails

We hereby object to the use of our contact data published as part of the imprint obligation
for sending unsolicited advertising and information material to us. The operators of this site
expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited advertising being
sent, such as spam e-mails.

## 4. Data collection on this website

### Request via e-mail

If you contact us by e-mail or any other way, your request, including all resulting personal data
(name, request) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request.
We do not pass on this data without your consent.

This data is processed on the basis of Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. b DSGVO if your request is related to the
fulfilment of a contract or is necessary to conduct pre-contractual measures. In all other cases,
the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries
addressed to us (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f DSGVO) or on your consent (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO) if
this was queried; in this case, the consent can be revoked at any time.

The data you sent to us via contact requests will remain with us until you request deletion,
revoke your consent to storage or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g. after
your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions โ in particular statutory
retention periods โ remain unaffected.

## 5. Privacy Policy for our social media appearances

### Data processing by social networks

We maintain publicly accessible profiles on social networks. The social networks we use in
detail can be found below.

Social networks can usually analyse your user behaviour comprehensively when you visit their
website or a website with integrated social media content (e.g. like buttons or advertising
banners). Visiting our social media presence triggers numerous data protection-related
processing operations. In detail:

If you are logged into your social media account and visit our social media presence, the
operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your user account. Under certain
circumstances, however, your personal data can also be recorded if you are not logged in or
do not have an account with the respective social media portal. In this case, this data is
collected, for example, via cookies that are stored on your device or by recording your IP
address.

With the help of the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can
create user profiles in which your preferences and interests are stored. In this way, interest-

based advertising can be displayed to you both inside and outside of the respective social
media presence. If you have an account with the respective social network, interest-based
advertising can be displayed on all devices on which you are logged in or were logged in.

Please also note that we cannot trace all processing operations on the social media portals.
Depending on the provider, additional processing operations may therefore be conducted by
the operators of the social media portals. Details can be found in the terms of use and data
protection regulations of the respective social media portals.

### Legal basis

Our social media appearances should ensure the widest possible presence on the Internet.
This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The analysis
processes initiated by the social networks may be based on different legal bases, which must
be specified by the operators of the social networks (e.g. consent within the meaning of Art.
6 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO).

### Controller and assertion of rights

If you visit one of our social media presences, we are jointly responsible with the operator of
the social media platform for the data processing operations triggered when visiting. In
principle, you can assert your rights (information, correction, deletion, restriction of
processing, data transferability and complaint) both against us and against the operator of the
respective social media portal.

Please note that despite the joint responsibility with the social media portal operators, we do
not have full influence on the data processing operations of the social media portals. Our
options are largely based on the corporate policy of the respective provider.

### Storage duration

The data collected directly by us via the social media presence will be deleted from our
systems as soon as the purpose for storing it no longer applies, you request us to delete it,
revoke your consent to storage or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies. Saved
cookies remain on your device until you delete them. Mandatory legal provisions โ especially
retention periods โ remain unaffected.

We have no influence on the storage period of your data, which is stored by the operators of
the social networks for their own purposes. For details, please contact the operators of the
social networks directly (e.g. in their Privacy Policy, see below).
