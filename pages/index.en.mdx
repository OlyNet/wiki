Here is also a quick introduction:
How to change from static IP to DHCP:
- First, plug your router in and connect to it (even if the Router has no internet connection)
- In your web-browser of choice, open the control panel of your Router. Typically, it is 192.168.01 or 192.168.1.1 (for TP-Link) but it can be a different address depending on the manufacturer. 
- Enter your credentials (if you don't remember, you will have to reset your router)
- Go to WAN/Internet Settings -> Select DHCP (Dynamic IP)
- Remove any manually entered IP, Subnet, Gateway, or DNS (if applicable)
- Save changes. You're done!

How to reset your router:

- Find the "reset" button: In the back of your router, near the ports, there should be a "reset" button. Sometimes, it is a little hole that you have to insert a sharp small object into, like a  small pen or staples (tacker nadeln)
- Insert the staple or hold the button for 10 seconds. If your router has lights, it could be blinking.
- Afterwards, it will be reset to factory settings. The default WIFI credentials (SSID and Password) will be in the back of the device.
You can now return to the previous guide to continue setting it up as DHCP.
### Office

You can find our office in the high-rise (Helene-Mayer-Ring 7B [Google Maps](https://g.page/r/CYubh5FnTtN0EBI/)) in the former
community room (GAP) in the 2nd floor. If you live in a Bungalow, your key
unfortunately only works for the staircase.

<Callout type="info" emoji="♻️"> 
    Moving out? You can recycle your used routers and we'll give them to new 
    dorm residents on a first-come-first-serve basis during office ours. Simply 
    bring them to us during our 
    respective opening hours.
