## General Information

Olynet is a student club that provides IT-Support for internet issues
to students living in the dormitory "Olympisches Dorf" in Munich.
You can also purchase pre-configured routers during our opening hours. 
Please bring your network data sheet with your IP addresses with you.

### Opening Hours

- Every Monday 20-21 o'clock

Please check our social media during semester breaks or public holidays.
If we are closed, we will let you know there.

### Office

You can find our office in the high-rise (Helene-Mayer-Ring 7) in the former
community room (GAP) in the 2nd floor. If you live in a Bungalow, your key
unfortunately only works for the staircase.

    Moving out? You can recycle your used routers and we'll give them to new 
    dorm residents on a first-come-first-serve basis during office ours. Simply 
    bring them to us or [GRAS](https://instagram.com/gras.olydorf) during our 
    respective opening hours.
