As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to § 7 Abs. 1 TMG. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we as a service provider are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which knowledge of a specific infringement of the law is known.

### Liability for links

Our offer contains links to external third-party websites, the content of which we have no influence on. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for this external content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking.

OlyNet e.V. is not responsible for ensuring that third-party content is complete, correct, up-to-date and legal and does not inadmissibly interfere with the legal interests of third parties. This also applies to the content of websites referred to by a link.
