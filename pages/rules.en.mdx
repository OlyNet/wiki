# Networking Rules

Here you can find rules for using the network in OlyDorf

- The LAN connection in your room provides free access to the MWN and, through that, to the internet. You must use it responsibly. Keep in mind that the bandwidth is shared among all residents. If everyone uses their connection to the max, the overall speed will drop.

- Make sure you’re using the correct router in your room. Some people are using DSL routers, which aren’t compatible and won't give you internet

- If your online meetings are crashing, try connecting without a router in between—it often runs more reliably that way

- If you need to reach the network admins, contact us via mail or in our office hours. Just so you know, we’re all working on a volunteer basis

- Stuwerk doesn’t offer support for personal devices—each user is responsible for their own equipment
  
## I still have questions, how can I contact you?
